How to use...
    <head>
      ...
      <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script> 
      <script src="//dragon.deparadox.com/drag-on.js"></script> 
      ...
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class='dragon'> 
        [content] 
      </div>
    </body>

Add a class "dragon" only to the root block with the content. Do not 
add the class to <body>. All block elements with active scrolling 
inside root element with a class "dragon", will be connected.

Be careful. Event capturing mousedown, between the root and the block 
with scrolling probably forbid smart scrolling. 
In this case, you can assign multiple nested root blocks.

<script> 
  $( function(){ 
    $( [selector] ).dragOn();
  }); 
</script>
