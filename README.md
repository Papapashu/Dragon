<h3>How to use...</h3>


    <head>
      ...
      <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script> 
      <script src="[path]/drag-on.js"></script> 
      ...
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class='dragon'> 
        [content] 
      </div>
    </body>


<p>Add a class "dragon" only to the root block with the content. Do not 
add the class to &lt;body&gt;. All block elements with active scrolling 
inside root element with a class "dragon", will be connected.
</p>
<p>Be careful.<br/>Event capturing mousedown, between the root and the block 
with scrolling, probably forbid smart scrolling. 
In this case, you can assign multiple nested root blocks.</p>


    <script> 
      $( function(){ 
        $( [selector] ).dragOn();
      }); 
    </script>
